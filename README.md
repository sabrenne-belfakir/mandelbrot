# Mandelbrot

## Introduction
Fractals are fascinating mathematical objects that exhibit self-similarity and infinite complexity. They are used in various fields, including physics, biology, and computer science, to model complex, natural phenomena.

## Sierpiński Triangle
The Sierpiński triangle is generated using a simple recursive method. Each iteration removes the middle triangle from a larger equilateral triangle, revealing a repeating pattern.

## Mandelbrot Set (Multibrot)
The Mandelbrot set is generated using complex numbers. Each point in the set is determined by iterating the function `z = z^2 + c`, where `z` and `c` are complex numbers. Points that do not escape to infinity belong to the set.

## Julia Set
Julia sets are closely related to the Mandelbrot set. They are generated by iterating the function `z = z^2 + c` for a fixed complex number `c`. Different values of `c` produce different Julia sets.

## Koch Snowflake
The Koch snowflake is generated using an iterative method. Starting with an equilateral triangle, each iteration replaces the middle third of each line segment with two line segments that form an equilateral "bump."

## Burning Ship
The Burning Ship fractal is similar to the Mandelbrot set but uses a modified iteration: `z = (|Re(z)| + i|Im(z)|)^2 + c`. This results in a fractal that resembles a ship in flames.
